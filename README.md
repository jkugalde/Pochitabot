## Summary

Pochitabot is a tetrapod that uses my N20 series elastic actuator. The modules are paired in each leg in a 5 bar mechanism configuration. Currently, it has position control and potential torsion sense (not yet implemented in the software). 

Parts are [HERE](https://grabcad.com/library/tetrapod-robot-1).
